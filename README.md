Even there will only be two of managers about the retire, still there was a lack of staff on this area. aproximately 1500 employee is eligible for the mentorship for the program which is shown in related csv file / table. 
* Company is required the fill up those empty positions as soon as possible. Since most of them are "Senior".
* Since there are around 1500 potential mentors are available right now, promote and train within the company is highly possible.
